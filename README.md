# stock-analysis
The Purpose of this analysis.
The Purpose of this Analysis was to help Steve determine the best stocks and also to refactor a Excel VBA code to collect necessary information in year 2017 and 2018. 
This would in turn determine if the stocks are worth investing in or not

Results: 
The Data had information on stocks from the years 2017 and 2018. the stock info had various information describing the said stock like ticker values, the opening and closing process etc. 
The goal was to retrieve the tickers, with their corresponding total daily volume, and the returns for each stock

Summary:
Advantages: It makes the code alittle bit more cleaner and precise and more organized and easily readable even for someone who does not know code
Disadvantages: if the information is too large, it might take a longer time to configure everythin. Also, using existing code is already risky if it was not done correctly
